This project was about a GUI for real time monitoring of medical signals like ECG, EMG, or EEG signals.
It includes options to view 3 signals at a time by choosing which channel you want to view now, and also options like slow, fast, pause, hide, show, zoom in, zoom out and also add labels of the 
signals playing at each channel.
Also, there's an option to view spectrogram of the medical signals and choose fro different color palettes and play with sliders to change the contrast value.

The following photos will illustrate the project more.


1- The following photo illustrate choosing ab ECG signal to view and also the spectrogram of the signal is shown.
